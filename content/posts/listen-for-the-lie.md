#### What if you thought you murdered your best friend? And if everyone else thought so too? And what if the truth doesn't matter?

After Lucy is found wandering the streets, covered in her best friend Savvy’s blood, everyone thinks she is a murderer. Lucy and Savvy were the golden girls of their small Texas town: pretty, smart, and enviable. Lucy married a dream guy with a big ring and an even bigger new home. Savvy was the social butterfly loved by all, and if you believe the rumors, especially popular with the men in town. It’s been years since that horrible night, a night Lucy can’t remember anything about, and she has since moved to LA and started a new life.

But now the phenomenally huge hit true crime podcast ["Listen for the Lie"](https://amzn.to/3UP7eIP) and its too-good looking host Ben Owens, have decided to investigate Savvy’s murder for the show’s second season. Lucy is forced to return to the place she vowed never to set foot in again to solve her friend’s murder, even if she is the one that did it.

The truth is out there, if we just listen.

### My review

#### WOWZA!

This is how you do it! This was a great true crime book whodunit! I was instantly drawn into the plot, loving how captivating and fun this book was. I had the [book](https://amzn.to/3UP7eIP)  and loved the narration. 

The premise was so intriguing: a woman who everyone believes killed her best friend. She isn't sure if she murdered her friend as she can't remember the night in question. She loved her friend and is certain she would never harm her but can't explain why she was found covered in her friend's blood. Buckle yourself in for this amazing and thrilling ride!

Lucy was found covered in her best friend Savvy’s blood. Everyone in town has their fingers pointed at her but the police don't have enough to charge her with murder. Lucy left town and did her best to carve out a life for herself in LA. When her grandmother invites her to come home for her party, Lucy can't help but say yes as she and her grandmother are close.

Ben Owens is a handsome and charming true crime book [("Listen for the Lie")](https://amzn.to/3UP7eIP) who is in Lucy's hometown to investigate Savvy's murder. Lucy finds herself back amongst the finger pointers and finds herself in the middle of Ben's investigation.

This was soooo good. I love books with snarky and witty characters. Lucy's sarcasm at times was dripping off the pages. Plus, her grandmother is a hoot! She was fun, sassy, and quick witted. She provided humor and put a smile on my face.

I enjoyed being a fly on the wall during [Listen for the Lie](https://amzn.to/3UP7eIP). Lucy hears Savvy's voice in her head throughout the book. It's a little creepy but also interesting. What is up with that? I thought I was done reading books with podcasts but [Listen for the Lie](https://amzn.to/3UP7eIP) was fantastic. I found it to be a well thought out, well written and riveting book. Plus, the narrators nailed it. 

I didn't want to stop reading. 
I too wanted to know whodunit. 
Was it Lucy? 
If not her, then who?


Gripping, dark, humorous, and well thought out.

I highly recommend the book.
