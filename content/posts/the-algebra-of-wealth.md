### Publisher's summary

Today's workers have more opportunities and mobility than any generation before. They also face unprecedented challenges, including inflation, labor and housing shortages, and climate volatility. Even the notion of retirement is undergoing a profound rethink, as our life spans extend and our relationship with work evolves. 

In this environment, the tried-and-true financial advice our parents followed no longer applies. It's time for a new playbook.

In [The Algebra of Wealth](https://amzn.to/3WN7drt), Galloway lays bare the rules of financial success in today's economy. In his characteristic unvarnished, no-BS style, he explains what you need to know in order to better your chances for economic security no matter what. You’ll learn:

- How to find and follow your talent, not your passion, when making career decisions
- How to ride and optimize big economic waves (hard truth: market dynamics always trump individual achievement)
- What small steps you can take that pay big returns later, including diversification and tax planning
- How stoicism can help you minimize spending and develop better financial habits

Bursting with practical, game-changing advice from one of the world’s most popular business school professors, The Algebra of Wealth is the practical guidebook you need to win today’s wealth game.

### My review

Unsurprisingly, Scott Galloway wrote another awesome book. I binged [this book](https://amzn.to/3WN7drt) in a day. In my humble opinion, this book is a must-read for everyone in their 20s or 30s, but it’s extremely beneficial for people of all ages. 

Unlike many other personal finance books, [The Algebra of Wealth](https://amzn.to/3WN7drt) has a lot of great life advice as well. Scott is filled with wisdom and experience, and this book teaches you about being smart with your money, saving, and investing. It also manages to explain some complex finance topics in an easy-to-understand way.

The only thing that threw me off is a recent interview clip with Scott' that went viral while promoting this book. In it, he discusses how younger generations have been screwed financially. There’s not really much about that in this book, which is fine. 

But also, I think it’s important for young people to understand we got the short end of the stick, but that doesn’t mean we get to make poor financial decisions. As Scott says multiple times in this book, there’s the world we wish we lived in and the world we actually live in.

This is a fantastic [book](https://amzn.to/3WN7drt), and it’s one I’m adding to my list of books to read with my son. 
Definitely check this one out if you want to learn about creating a life that has financial security.
