In Kiev, Ukraine on April 23, 2006, local police received a notice to investigate a strange man who suddenly stood in the middle of the street. To avoid traffic jams, police officers quickly arrived. Here, they saw a young man wearing outdated clothes from half a century ago and a camera. The young man standing in the middle of the highway with a panicked and confused expression was quickly received and handled by the police.

At this time, the officers realized that this young man was not as normal as they thought. So who is this guy? And what's happening to him?

### THE BOY FROM NOWHERE

After approaching the young man, the police immediately questioned the young man's identification documents.

The police felt even more confused when they began reading the information in Sergei's identification card. According to the identification card above, Sergei was born in 1932, which means that this year he should have been 74 years old, but in fact he looked like he was just over 20 years old.

At the hospital, the person who received this strange case was psychologist Dr. Pablo Kutrikov. When he learned that he had to receive patients with time deviations from the officers, he reassured the police that psychologists had encountered many of these cases, so the police could leave with peace of mind.

However, another problem appeared, even though the photos were in the camera, because the camera was no longer in production, it was extremely difficult to be able to wash these photos. After searching the whole country, the two finally found a camera expert named Adim Poisner who was contacted to help them both. Even though there were no favorable conditions, fortunately, the photos were still successfully developed.

### CLUES

After the photos were shown, people couldn't believe their eyes. Vehicles, roads and people all come from the 50s. Not only that, in Sergei's film there are also buildings before being included in city planning. Of course, the photo of the strange object was also found, and Sergei was not lying.

Not only that, normally, these types of photos are usually kept for about 2-3 years at normal temperatures. If you want to keep it longer, the film rolls need to be placed in a low temperature and dry space. However, even with this method, the tapes are only kept for 20 years. Along with that, the image quality of the film rolls will be significantly reduced after being left for too long. However, Sergei's roll of film from 1958, after being developed, produced very high-quality images. That shows that these photos were only taken recently.

After a long day of interviews, Sergei was taken to the hospital room and carefully guarded to rest. The next morning, the nurse was planning to wake Sergei up for breakfast and further examination. However, he was not there. Just as he appeared, Sergei Ponomarenko has disappeared without a trace.

After the disappearance of Sergei Ponomarenko, the only clues the police had were a camera and pictures developed from film rolls. At the same time, inspectors also began looking for other clues in the developed photos. Thanks to that, they found another connection of Sergei from the past, his girlfriend, Valentina, now 70 years old.

She recalled that her ex-lover suddenly disappeared one day in 1958 but returned within a few days.

Ms. Valentina also added: 
> "When Sergei returned, he also described to me about microwave ovens and later when I first used them, I remembered what he said and was really surprised because they were not wrong at all. ”

### TRUTH

However, when we dug deeper into this event, we realized that all the videos and images of Sergei on the internet came from a science TV show about aliens, The Alien on OnePlus One. in Ukraine in 2012. And in the third episode of the series, it is the same story we told above.
However, according to YouTuber Joe Scott, who also believes that the scenes in the video were recorded very sloppily and lacked logic. Not only that, in some footage there are also countless flaws.

Although The Alien is a documentary based on theories about aliens and the universe, they also assert that "The episodes in the series are all stories based on the stories of the characters involved." relating to certain events, or urban legends. Therefore, the videos will not be completely accurate and will require further research when used for academic purposes. And deciding whether aliens exist or not is all up to your own opinion.”
